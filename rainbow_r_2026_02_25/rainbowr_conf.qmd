## NYC experiencing more frequent climate hazards and acute weather events

::: notes
New York City faces risks from four types of flood hazards: rainwater, river & coastal (traditional FEMA risk maps), and groundwater

NYC has a history of filling in surface stream channels and inland marsh, which would have once absorbed and conveyed stormwater to larger bodies of water. Instead, the city is dependent on a nearly 200-year-old network of 7,500 miles of sewer pipes to collect and convey sewage and stormwater to 14 wastewater treatment plants.
